Oh this is actually pretty cool, I am writing code for the website that I made in class about a data frame that's pretty awesome... Beer! still figuring it out but the following statistics crome from the data frame "https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv" describing difference beer brands and their quantity and populartity amoung different markets.



```{r}
beer_mrkt <- read.csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv")
```
